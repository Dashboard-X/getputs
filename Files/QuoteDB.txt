Attain the supreme wealth, wisdom, and you will have everything.  | Benjamin Franklin
Wickedness is a myth invented by good people to account for the curious attraction of others.  | Oscar Wilde

America is a nation with many flaws, but hopes so vast that only the cowardly would refuse to acknowledge them.  | James Michener
A popular Government without popular information or the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy or perhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance, and a people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm themselves with the power knowledge gives.  | James Madison
A tyrant must put on the appearance of uncommon devotion to religion. Subjects are less apprehensive of illegal treatment from a ruler whom they consider god-fearing and pious. On the other hand, they do less easily move against him, believing that he has the gods on his side.  | Aristotle

I perceived that to express those impressions, to write that essential book, which is the only true one, a great writer does not, in the current meaning of the word, invent it, but, since it exists already in each one of us, interprets it. The duty and the task of a writer are those of an interpreter.  | Marcel Proust
If you want to get laid, go to college, but if you want an education, go to the library.  | Frank Zappa

If we work upon marble, it will perish; if we work upon brass, time will efface it; if we rear temples, they will crumble into dust; but if we work upon immortal minds and instill into them just principles, we are then engraving that upon tablets which no time will efface, but will brighten and brighten to all eternity.  | Daniel Webster
Many books require no thought from those who read them, and for a very simple reason; they made no such demand upon those who wrote them.  | Charles Caleb Colton
Admit it, sport-utility-vehicle owners! It`s shaped a little differently, but it`s a station wagon! And you do not drive it across rivers! You drive it across the Wal-Mart parking lot!  | Dave Barry
Love is something far more than desire for sexual intercourse; it is the principal means of escape from the loneliness which afflicts most men and women throughout the greater part of their lives.  | Bertrand Russell
No sooner do we depart from sense and instinct to follow reason but we are insensibly drawn into uncouth paradoxes, difficulties, and inconsistencies, which multiply and grow upon us as we advance in speculation; till at length, having wandered through many intricate mazes, we find ourselves just where we were, or, which is worse, sit down in a forlorn scepticism.  | George Berkeley
True pacifism is not unrealistic submission to an evil power...it is rather a courageous confrontation with evil by the power of love, in the faith that it is better to be the recipient of violence than the inflicter of it, since the latter only multiplies the existence of violence and bitterness in the universe, while the former may develop a sense of shame in the opponent, and thereby bring about a transformation and change of heart.  | Martin Luther King Jr.

We have reason to believe that man first walked upright to free his hands for masturbation.  | Lily Tomlin
Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I needn`t argue about that; I`m right, and I will be proved right. We are more popular than Jesus now; I don`t know which will go first -- rock`n`roll or Christianity. Jesus was all right, but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It`s them twisting it that ruins it for me.  | John Lennon
The difference between the most dissimilar characters, between a philosopher and a common street porter, for example, seems to arise not so much from nature, as from habit, custom, and education.  | Adam Smith

The people who cast the votes don?t decide an election, the people who count the votes do.  | Joseph Stalin
Pure love and suspicion cannot dwell together: at the door where the latter enters, the former makes its exit.  | Alexandre Dumas
Providence protects children and idiots. I know because I have tested it.  | Mark Twain
I figured out why I`m not getting seriously rich. I write newspaper columns. Nobody ever makes newspaper columns into Major Motion Pictures starring Tom Cruise. The best you can hope for, with a newspaper column, is that people will like it enough to attach it to their refrigerators with magnets shaped like fruit.  | Dave Barry
When I come up against a director who has a concept that I don`t agree with, or maybe I just haven`t thought of it or whatever, I`d be more prone to go with them than my own because I want to be out of control as an actor, I want them to have the control, otherwise it`s going to become predictably my work, and that`s not fun.  | Jack Nicholson
How strange that nature does not knock, and yet does not intrude!  | Emily Dickinson
Nothing is so fatal to religion as indifference.  | Edmund Burke

Religion is essentially the art and the theory of the remaking of man. Man is not a finished creation.  | Edmund Burke
As Mankind becomes more liberal, they will be more apt to allow that all those who conduct themselves as worthy members of the community are equally entitled to the protections of civil government. I hope ever to see America among the foremost nations of justice and liberality.  | George Washington
The truth is, of course, that the curtness of the Ten Commandments is an evidence, not of the gloom and narrowness of a religion, but, on the contrary, of its liberality and humanity. It is shorter to state the things forbidden than the things permitted: precisely because most things are permitted, and only a few things are forbidden.  | GK Chesterton

There are two types of education. One should teach us how to make a living, And the other how to live.  | John Adams
The fact that a believer is happier than a sceptic is no more to the point than the fact that a drunken man is happier than a sober one. The happiness of credulity is a cheap and dangerous quality.  | George Bernard Shaw

Our hate is not hurting them at al, but our hate is turning our days and nights into a hellish turmoil.  | Dale Carnegie

Let us be thankful for the fools. But for them the rest of us could not succeed.  | Mark Twain
Thus far, the reputed idiot Bush has graduated from Yale and Harvard, made a stack of cash in the oil industry, become the first consecutive-term governor of Texas, defeated a dual-term VP for the presidency, and led his party to [November 5th`s] extraordinary triumphs.

Immature love says: `I love you because I need you.` Mature love says: `I need you because I love you.`  | Erich Fromm
Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable.  | C.S. Lewis

I perceived that to express those impressions, to write that essential book, which is the only true one, a great writer does not, in the current meaning of the word, invent it, but, since it exists already in each one of us, interprets it. The duty and the task of a writer are those of an interpreter.  | Marcel Proust
When this girl at the museum asked me who I liked better, Monet or Manet, I said, `I like mayonnaise.` She just stared at me, so I said it again, louder. Then she left. I guess she went to try to find some mayonnaise for me.  | Jack Handey

She was what we used to call a suicide blond - dyed by her own hand.  | Saul Bellow
Born often under another sky, placed in the middle of an always moving scene, himself driven by the irresistible torrent which draws all about him, the American has no time to tie himself to anything, he grows accustomed only to change, and ends by regarding it as the natural state of man.

The price of freedom is eternal vigilance.  | Thomas Jefferson
It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live.  | Marcus Aurelius

Most of the important things in the world have been accomplished by people who have kept on trying when there seemed to be no hope at all.  | Dale Carnegie
Of all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies.

Lewis
Question with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of reason, than that of blind-folded fear.  | Thomas Jefferson

The philosophy of one century is the common sense of the next.  | Henry Ward Beecher
I have always been offended by the song that says, `Everything is beautiful in its own way.` If everything is beautiful, then the word `beautiful` has no meaning. If everything were purple, there would be no word `purple` in the language because it would not distinguish one thing from another.  | Thomas Sowell
When good men die their goodness does not perish, but lives though they are gone. As for the bad, all that was theirs dies and is buried with them.  | Euripides

It is fast approaching the point where I don`t want to elect anyone stupid enough to want the job.  | Erna Bombeck
Every individual...generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention.  | Adam Smith

Truth is confirmed by inspection and delay; falsehood by haste and uncertainty.  | Tacitus

The miracle is not that we do this work, but that we are happy to do it.  | Mother Teresa

The great principle which this house ought to guard and cherish is that, when the tax collector comes to the private citizen and takes from him of his wealth for the services of the public, the whole of that money taken shall go for the purposes for which it is intended, and that no private interests, however powerfully they may be organized and however eloquently advocated, shall thrust their dirty fingers into the pie and take the profits for themselves.  | Winston Churchill
