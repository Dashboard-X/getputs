                    <br />                    
                    which items were e-mailed the most

                    <br />
                    Based on this data collection, the automated algorithms try to make an estimation of which of the items are the hottest and most informative in a given time frame.

                The rule of thumb is, always submit content which was useful to you and which you think others will find useful.
                <br />
                The title of a submission plays a very important role in igniting reader interest. 
                <br />
                Skillful naming is crucial to getting the attention of getputs readers.    
                <br />
                But please don't revert to submitting misleading titles, your submission rights will be revoked if you try to submit inaccurate and misleading titles.

                    Private Conversations via E-Mail. 
                    <br />
                    For some categories where a user would want to perform e-commerce operations (buying/selling stuff) or categories like real-estate, matrimonials, dating etc. where there is a need of private conversations, the registered users can communicate with the person who submitted the article via e-mail.
                    <br />
                    For example, if a user submitted the following item: "A vintage Bike for sale.", and if you are looking to buy a bike, then you can directly send an e-mail to the submitter via getputs. 
                    <br />
                    For private conversations, you won't be able to see the e-mail address of the submitter (unless the submitter explicitly specifies and e-mail address).
