                    Back in the days, the getputs team was having a hard time keeping up with all information 
                    flying around everywhere.
                    <br />
                    So we thought, why not build something that would let others suggest great content to us and that would 
                    let us suggest and share information with others. 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This is how getputs started.

                    what kind of post does each user submit, 
                    <br />
                    what items did a user comment on,

                    what items did a user save to the getputs account,
                    <br />                    
                    which items were e-mailed the most

                    <br />
                    Based on this data collection, the automated algorithms try to make an estimation of which of the items are the hottest and most informative in a given time frame.
